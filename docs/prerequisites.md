## Prerequisites
1. K8s cluster(i'm using kind, perhaps could be minikube etc..)
2. kubectl
3. docker-compose for building the apps images for k8s (can also be used for local debugging - both the kafka broker, also option for docker containers of the apps))
4. nodejs (i'm using v20) & nestjs for local debugging
